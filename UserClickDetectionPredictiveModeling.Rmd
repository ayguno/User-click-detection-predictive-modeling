# Introduction and summary

# Loading data

We will start working with the small subset of the training data that contain 100.000 observations just to develops some expectations from the data. The actual training set contains ~ 200 milion observations, we will attempt to download and process it once we locked down our processing and feature engineering pipeline.

```{r, cache=TRUE}

train_sample <- read.csv("train_sample.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
